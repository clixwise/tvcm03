Thatâ€™s a very thoughtful point! If **CEAP class assignments** are determined by highly experienced surgeons, the measurement error for assigning CEAP classes (C0-C6) is likely **very low** or negligible. This speaks to the **accuracy and reliability** of the data.

However, the issue of **false positives** in this context doesnâ€™t arise from measurement error but rather from the nature of **statistical hypothesis testing** itself. Let me clarify:

---

### False Positives in Statistical Testing
1. **Source of False Positives**:
   - False positives (Type I errors) in statistical tests occur **not because of data quality**, but because of **random chance** when testing multiple hypotheses.
   - For example, if you test 7 CEAP classes at the standard \( \alpha = 0.05 \), there is still a 5% probability that each test could show significance **by chance alone**, even if there is no true difference.

2. **Why Multiple Comparisons Matter**:
   - Testing multiple CEAP classes increases the overall chance of observing at least one false positive (significant result due to chance).
   - This cumulative error is what Bonferroni or FDR corrections address.

---

### Role of High-Quality Data
- Your data's reliability (thanks to expert surgeons) **reduces concerns about false positives due to measurement error**.
- However, the risk of statistical false positives **due to multiple comparisons** remains **independent** of data quality.  
  Even with perfect data, statistical hypothesis testing can produce false positives purely by random chance when testing multiple hypotheses.

---

### Should You Apply Corrections?
Yes, **Bonferroni** or **FDR corrections** are still appropriate because:
1. You are performing **multiple independent tests** (one per CEAP class).
2. Statistical false positives can occur purely from testing multiple hypotheses, even with perfect measurements.

---

### Practical Recommendation:
- **Use Bonferroni** for a conservative approach if you need very strong control over false positives.
- **Use FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg)** for a balanced approach that allows for some false positives but increases the power to detect true signals.

By applying these corrections, you are ensuring that any significant results are robust and not due to random chanceâ€”no matter how precise the measurements are.
