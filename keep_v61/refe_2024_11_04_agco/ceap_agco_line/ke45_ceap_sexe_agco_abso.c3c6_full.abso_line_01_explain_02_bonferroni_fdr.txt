Thank you for sharing the results! Here's the interpretation of the outcomes:

---

### Results Overview:
- **Raw p-values** are used to test whether the ages of males and females differ significantly for each CEAP class.
- **Corrected p-values** (Bonferroni) account for multiple comparisons to control the overall Type I error rate.

### Significant CEAP Classes:
- After Bonferroni correction (`p_value_corrected`), **none of the CEAP classes** show a significant difference in age between males and females.

### Detailed Observations:
- **C3** has the smallest raw p-value (0.045), suggesting a potential difference in age between genders.  
  However, after Bonferroni correction (`p_value_corrected = 0.361821`), it is no longer significant.
- Other CEAP classes (NA, C6, C4, C0, C2, C1, C5) have p-values much higher than the threshold (typically 0.05), indicating no evidence of gender differences in age.

### Conclusion:
The analysis does not show any statistically significant differences in age distributions between males and females for the CEAP classes after correcting for multiple comparisons.

Would you like me to explore other tests or adjust the correction method (e.g., FDR instead of Bonferroni) to be less conservative? Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
