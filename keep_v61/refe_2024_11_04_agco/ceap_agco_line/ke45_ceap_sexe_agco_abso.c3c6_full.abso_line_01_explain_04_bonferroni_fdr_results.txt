No problem at all, and thanks for the updated results! Here's the interpretation:

### Key Results:
1. **CEAP Class C3**:
   - **Raw p-value**: \( 0.045 \)  
     This suggests a potential gender-based age difference for class **C3**.
   - **Bonferroni-corrected p-value**: \( 0.361 \)  
     After Bonferroni correction, the result is no longer significant.
   - **FDR-corrected p-value**: \( 0.316 \)  
     FDR correction is less conservative but still does not indicate significance.

2. **All Other CEAP Classes (NA, C6, C4, C0, C2, C1, C5)**:
   - **Raw p-values** are above \( 0.05 \), and after correction (Bonferroni/FDR), the results remain far from significance.

---

### Conclusion:
- **C3** showed a potential signal in the raw p-value, but this signal disappears when correcting for multiple comparisons, both with Bonferroni and FDR.
- Therefore, there is **no significant difference** in age between males and females across the tested CEAP classes after accounting for multiple testing.

---

### Takeaway:
- The FDR correction is less conservative than Bonferroni, yet both methods agree on the final conclusion: **no significant differences**.
- If needed, I can help with visualizing the results or performing further subgroup analyses.
