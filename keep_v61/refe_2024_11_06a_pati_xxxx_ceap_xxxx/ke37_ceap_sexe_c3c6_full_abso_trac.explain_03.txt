Yes, **bootstrapping** can be a key part of the **4.2 follow-up strategy** because it provides a **robust resampling method** to validate observed deviations and test their significance.

---

### Why Use Bootstrapping?

Bootstrapping repeatedly samples the original data **with replacement** to:
1. **Simulate variability** in the observed deviations.
2. Build a **distribution** of deviations under the null hypothesis (global sex imbalance alone explains observed counts).
3. Provide **confidence intervals** for the differences or validate p-values from Chi-square tests.

---

### Key Steps for Bootstrapping in Your Case:
1. Generate **bootstrap samples** of male and female counts based on the expected proportions.
2. Recalculate deviations (or test statistics) for each bootstrap sample.
3. Build a distribution of the test statistic (e.g., Chi-square values).
4. Compare the observed deviations (or Chi-square) to the bootstrapped distribution to check significance.

Would you like me to implement this as part of the current script? I can add bootstrapping to validate the Chi-square results for each CEAP class! Let me know.


To **implement bootstrapping** into your current script, we will add the following steps:

1. Generate **bootstrap samples** for each CEAP class using expected proportions for males and females.
2. Recalculate the deviations (or Chi-square statistic) for each bootstrap sample.
3. Compare the observed Chi-square values to the bootstrapped distribution to determine significance.

Here is the updated script with **bootstrapping**:

### Key Changes:
1. **Bootstrapping Logic**:
   - Simulates data under the null hypothesis using **binomial sampling** based on expected proportions.
   - Builds a distribution of Chi-square statistics.
2. **Bootstrap p-value**:
   - Compares the observed Chi-square statistic to the bootstrapped distribution to validate its significance.

Run this code to see the results, including **bootstrap p-values** for each CEAP class. Let me know if you need further clarifications or adjustments!
