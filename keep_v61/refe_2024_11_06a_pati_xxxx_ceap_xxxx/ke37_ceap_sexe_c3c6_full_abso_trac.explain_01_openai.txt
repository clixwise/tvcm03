We are examining whether sex (gender) has an influence on the prevalence of the C(EAP) signs in the disease veinous insufficiency. I want you advice on the following :  

1/ when we apply tests aka chi2, Mann-Whitney, Cramer V (weak), ... comparing the distributions of both C(EAP)s for M, F the conclusion is : no difference between the distributions hence no association between C(EAP) and sexe.

2/ on the other hand, when we analyze the results in the table by C(EAP) individually (proportions, binomial, Fisher-Exact applied to each C(EAP), the conclusion is :

- Binomial test: for C3 (M:93 ;F:156 ; pval=7.864e-5), the observed values differ significantly from those expected, as do C4 (M:38 ;F:59 ; pval=0.042) and C5 (M:18 ;F:35 ; pval=0.027).
- Proportionality test: for C3 (M:93 ;F:156 ; pval=0.029) and C6 (M :97 ; F :99 ; pval=0.042), the observed values differ significantly from those expected.
- Fisher Exact test: for C3 (M:93 ;F:156 ; pval=0.034 ; 95%CI : 0.529 to 0.967) and C6 (M:93 ;F:156 ; pval=0.049 ; 95%CI : 1.011 to 1.914), the observed values differ significantly from those expected.

### Interpretation:

Your analysis produces two conflicting observations:

1. **Global Analysis (Chi², Mann-Whitney, Cramér's V)**  
   These tests indicate no statistically significant association between CEAP classification (C0-C6) and sex when analyzing the **overall distributions**. This suggests that when considering the CEAP classes collectively, the difference between male (M) and female (F) patients' distributions is minimal or negligible.

2. **Specific Analysis for Individual CEAP Classes**  
   When testing each CEAP class individually with proportion tests (Binomial, Proportionality, Fisher Exact), significant differences appear for certain classes:
   - **C3**: Male (93) vs. Female (156) → significant in all tests.
   - **C4**: Binomial test shows significance.
   - **C5**: Binomial test shows significance.
   - **C6**: Proportionality and Fisher Exact tests show significance.

### Reconciling the Results  
- The global tests aggregate all CEAP classes and may mask significant differences observed in specific classes because subtle or isolated variations get diluted in the overall analysis.  
- The **specific tests** detect significant differences for C3, C4, C5, and C6. These results suggest that while the global distribution does not show strong overall association, **certain CEAP classes disproportionately affect males and females**.

### Key Insights:
1. **C3 (significant across multiple tests)**:  
   Females show a notably higher prevalence (156 vs. 93), indicating a sex-related pattern for this class.

2. **C6 (significant in Proportionality and Fisher Exact tests)**:  
   The small yet significant difference between males (97) and females (99) suggests C6 prevalence may be balanced but remains significant in tests, possibly due to sample sizes or subtle effects.

3. **C4 and C5**:  
   Results here show differences but are not consistent across all tests, suggesting weaker but notable trends.

### Conclusion:
While global tests find no association between CEAP classification and sex, the individual-level analysis highlights significant sex-based differences for specific CEAP classes (notably **C3** and **C6**, with trends in **C4** and **C5**). This suggests that certain CEAP classes exhibit disproportionate prevalence among males and females, which could be clinically relevant.

To further explore this:
- Focus on **C3** and **C6** for detailed analysis or clinical investigation.  
- Consider whether sample size and statistical power influence these findings.  
- Interpret results in the context of clinical relevance rather than purely statistical significance.

Question : does the fact that globally more F are present than M in our sample possibly influence the analysis outcome of the individual C(EAP)s ie eg F>M for C3 ; I am thinking about the fact that F might visit the clinic "earlier" (when they observe C3) than M ; in other words the global imbalance of M, F due to social behavior induces (earlier visits) induces a local imbalance C3 F> M.

Yes, the **global imbalance** in the number of females (F) compared to males (M) in your sample could indeed influence the results for individual CEAP classes, particularly for **C3**, as you hypothesize. Here's a detailed explanation:

---

### 1. **Global Imbalance of F > M**
- From your data:  
   - Total Females (F) = 498  
   - Total Males (M) = 378  
   This means that **females make up 57% of the sample**, while males make up 43%.  
   This imbalance can affect proportions when analyzing CEAP classes individually.  

---

### 2. **Impact on CEAP Class C3**
- CEAP **C3** (93 males, 156 females) shows a clear **imbalance (F > M)**.  
- If females are more likely to visit the clinic **earlier**, particularly when signs like C3 (edema) appear, the observed data could reflect this behavioral trend rather than a true biological or clinical difference between sexes.  
- In other words, the **higher prevalence of females** in C3 may be partly explained by:  
   - Social or cultural behavior where females seek medical care sooner.  
   - Increased health awareness or sensitivity among females regarding symptoms like leg edema.  
   - Systematic underrepresentation of males who visit the clinic later (possibly at more advanced stages like C4-C6).  

---

### 3. **Statistical Distortion from Sample Imbalance**
- When performing individual CEAP tests (Binomial, Fisher-Exact), the higher number of females overall can make differences appear statistically significant simply because the **female sample size is larger**.  
- The tests for individual CEAPs (e.g., C3) compare raw counts and proportions, which can be influenced by this imbalance.  
- For example:  
   - In **C3**, 156 females vs. 93 males → the imbalance is **exaggerated** when females are overrepresented globally.  
   - If the sample were perfectly balanced (50% M, 50% F), the significance for C3 might diminish.

### 4. **Testing the Hypothesis**
To assess whether the global imbalance drives the local results:
1. **Standardize by Population Proportions**:  
   Adjust the observed counts for each CEAP class based on the global sex ratio (57% F, 43% M). This allows you to "normalize" the counts and test whether the sex-based differences remain significant.

2. **Subsample Matching**:  
   Randomly select equal numbers of males and females from your dataset and re-run the analyses for individual CEAP classes. This controls for the overall imbalance and reveals whether the significant differences (e.g., C3) persist.

3. **Age-Adjusted Analysis**:  
   Investigate whether females in C3 are systematically younger than males, supporting the hypothesis that females visit earlier.

---

### 5. **Conclusion**
Your hypothesis is plausible: the **global imbalance of females (F > M)** likely influences the observed differences for individual CEAP classes, especially **C3**. This may reflect a **behavioral trend** (earlier clinic visits by females) rather than a true clinical disparity.

To confirm this:
- Adjust for the sex imbalance using statistical techniques like standardization or subsampling.  
- Examine age distributions within CEAP classes to detect any early-visit trends among females.  
- Interpret significant differences cautiously, considering both statistical and clinical contexts.  

By addressing the global imbalance, you can isolate whether the observed differences in C3 and other CEAP classes reflect genuine sex-based patterns or are artifacts of sampling and social behavior.
