### 4. **Testing the Hypothesis**
To assess whether the global imbalance drives the local results:
1. **Standardize by Population Proportions**:  
   Adjust the observed counts for each CEAP class based on the global sex ratio (57% F, 43% M). This allows you to "normalize" the counts and test whether the sex-based differences remain significant.

2. **Subsample Matching**:  
   Randomly select equal numbers of males and females from your dataset and re-run the analyses for individual CEAP classes. This controls for the overall imbalance and reveals whether the significant differences (e.g., C3) persist.

3. **Age-Adjusted Analysis**:  
   Investigate whether females in C3 are systematically younger than males, supporting the hypothesis that females visit earlier.

To address **4.1: Standardize by Population Proportions** and adjust the observed counts for each CEAP class based on the global sex ratio (57% F, 43% M), here’s an approach using Python.

We will:
1. Calculate the **expected counts** for each CEAP class if they were proportional to the global sex ratio.  
2. Compare the adjusted counts with the observed counts to identify significant deviations.

### Step-by-Step Python Code

Here’s a Python implementation:

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Observed Counts**: Input the observed counts for males and females across CEAP classes.
2. **Expected Counts**: Calculate expected counts using the global proportions (43% for males, 57% for females).
3. **Deviations**: Compute deviations between observed and expected counts for each class.
4. **Chi-Square Test**: Perform a Chi-square goodness-of-fit test to assess whether the observed counts significantly differ from the expected counts.

### Output Table Example:
| CEAP | Males | Females | Expected_Males | Expected_Females | Male_Deviation | Female_Deviation | Chi2   | P-value  |
|------|-------|---------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|--------|----------|
| C0   | 31    | 36      | 29.03         | 37.97           | 1.97          | -1.97           | 0.134  | 0.714    |
| C3   | 93    | 156     | 107.7         | 141.3           | -14.7         | 14.7            | 4.392  | 0.036*   |
| ...  | ...   | ...     | ...           | ...             | ...           | ...             | ...    | ...      |

- **`Chi2` and `P-value`** columns show the results of the goodness-of-fit test for each CEAP class.
- A **significant P-value** (e.g., < 0.05) indicates that the observed counts significantly deviate from what would be expected based on the global sex ratio.

### Insights:
1. You can identify whether classes like **C3** have an overrepresentation of females that cannot be explained solely by the global sex imbalance.
2. Adjusting for proportions gives a more balanced interpretation of the results. If deviations persist, they may indicate a **true clinical difference** or behavioral trend.
