The displayed **C3 Chi-square distribution** shows key characteristics that can help refine our conclusions regarding potential male-female imbalances for this CEAP class. Here are a few observations and implications:

---

### **1. Distribution Shape**  
The bootstrapped Chi-square values are **strongly skewed right**, with most bootstrap samples resulting in **small Chi-square values** near zero. This indicates that deviations from the expected counts due to random sampling rarely exceed the observed Chi-square value of **1.509**.

---

### **2. Observed Chi-square Value Placement**  
The **observed Chi-square** (1.509) is marked with a **red dashed line**. Most of the bootstrap Chi-square values fall **below 1.509**, but the tail extends slightly beyond this point.

- The observed Chi-square value is **not extreme** compared to the bootstrapped distribution, suggesting the deviation (fewer males, more females in C3) **does not exceed what might occur under random chance**.

---

### **3. Bootstrap-derived P-value**  
The bootstrap P-value calculated earlier for C3 was **0.071**, which aligns with the visualization. It suggests a **marginally non-significant result** under the common alpha level of 0.05.

- If we relax the significance threshold (e.g., to 0.10), C3 might warrant further exploration as a "weak signal" indicating possible behavioral differences or biases (e.g., earlier clinic visits by females).

---

### **Next Steps for Refinement**  
1. **Include additional covariates** (e.g., age distribution): Test whether the observed imbalance for C3 persists when controlling for age differences between males and females.

2. **Analyze social/behavioral factors**: If females are more likely to seek treatment earlier, this could be explored through:
   - Logistic regression using age and gender as predictors for C3 presence.
   - Comparing ages within C3 for males and females.

3. **Combine adjacent CEAP classes**: Grouping related classes (e.g., C2-C3) could increase power to detect gender differences.

Would you like to refine further analyses for age, or move on to visualizing **C6**?
