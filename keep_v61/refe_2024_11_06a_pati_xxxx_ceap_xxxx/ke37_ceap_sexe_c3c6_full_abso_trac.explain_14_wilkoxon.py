You're absolutely right! This row-wise data is much more suitable for the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test (Mann-Whitney U Test). With this format, we can directly compare the distribution of CEAP classes between males and females. Let's modify our approach to use this data:

```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import mannwhitneyu

# Assuming your data is in a DataFrame called 'df'
# df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')  # If you need to load the data

def wilcoxon_test(data):
    # Create numeric mapping for CEAP classes
    ceap_mapping = {'NA': 0, 'C0': 1, 'C1': 2, 'C2': 3, 'C3': 4, 'C4': 5, 'C5': 6, 'C6': 7}
    
    # Convert CEAP classes to numeric values
    data['ceap_numeric'] = data['ceap'].map(ceap_mapping)
    
    # Separate data by gender
    male_data = data[data['sexe'] == 'M']['ceap_numeric']
    female_data = data[data['sexe'] == 'F']['ceap_numeric']
    
    # Perform Mann-Whitney U test
    statistic, p_value = mannwhitneyu(male_data, female_data, alternative='two-sided')
    
    return statistic, p_value

# Perform the test
statistic, p_value = wilcoxon_test(df)

print(f"Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test Results:")
print(f"Statistic: {statistic}")
print(f"p-value: {p_value:.4f}")
```

This implementation:

1. Creates a numeric mapping for CEAP classes (NA=0, C0=1, ..., C6=7).
2. Converts the CEAP classes to numeric values.
3. Separates the data by gender.
4. Performs the Mann-Whitney U test on the numeric CEAP values between males and females.

This approach will give you a single p-value that indicates whether there's a significant difference in the distribution of CEAP classes between males and females across all classes.

If you want to analyze specific CEAP classes or subgroups, you can modify the function to filter the data accordingly before performing the test.

You're absolutely correct, and I appreciate you pointing that out. The Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test (Mann-Whitney U Test) in this context indeed provides an overall comparison of the CEAP class distributions between males and females, rather than a class-by-class analysis like Fisher's Exact Test.

Let's clarify the key differences:

1. **Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test (as implemented now):**
   - Compares the overall distribution of CEAP classes between males and females.
   - Provides a single p-value for the entire distribution.
   - Treats CEAP classes as ordinal data.
   - Useful for answering: "Is there a significant difference in the overall severity of venous disease between males and females?"

2. **Fisher's Exact Test (as implemented previously):**
   - Analyzes each CEAP class separately.
   - Provides a p-value for each individual class.
   - Treats each class as a categorical variable.
   - Useful for answering: "Is there a significant difference in the proportion of males vs. females for each specific CEAP class?"

If you want to maintain a class-by-class analysis similar to Fisher's Exact Test while using the row-wise data, you could implement a series of chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests for each CEAP class. Here's how you might do that:

```python
from scipy.stats import fisher_exact
import pandas as pd

def class_by_class_fisher(data):
    results = {}
    for ceap_class in data['ceap'].unique():
        contingency_table = pd.crosstab(data['sexe'], data['ceap'] == ceap_class) # CREATES THE CONTINGENCY TABLE
        _, p_value = fisher_exact(contingency_table)
        results[ceap_class] = p_value
    return results

# Assuming 'df_line' is your DataFrame
class_results = class_by_class_fisher(df)

print("Fisher's Exact Test Results (class by class):")
for ceap_class, p_value in class_results.items():
    print(f"{ceap_class} - p-value: {p_value:.4f}")
```

This approach would give you a p-value for each CEAP class, similar to what we achieved with the previous Fisher's Exact Test implementation, but using your row-wise data.
