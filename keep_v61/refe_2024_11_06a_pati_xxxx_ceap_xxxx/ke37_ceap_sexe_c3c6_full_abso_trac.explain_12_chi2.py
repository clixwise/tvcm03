You're right, and I apologize for the oversight in my previous code. The individual class results look strange because the chi-square test for independence requires a 2x2 contingency table for each class, which we didn't properly set up. Let's correct this and provide a more appropriate analysis:
'''
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

# Create the contingency table
data = {
    'NA': [52, 53],
    'C0': [31, 36],
    'C1': [5, 6],
    'C2': [44, 54],
    'C3': [93, 156],
    'C4': [38, 59],
    'C5': [18, 35],
    'C6': [97, 99]
}

contingency_table = pd.DataFrame(data, index=['Male', 'Female'])

# Overall Chi-Square test
chi2, p_value, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(contingency_table)
print(f"Overall Chi-Square statistic: {chi2:.4f}")
print(f"Overall p-value: {p_value:.4f}")

for ceap_class in contingency_table.columns:
    # Create a DataFrame for Current and Other
    current_counts = contingency_table[ceap_class] 
    # Calculate Other counts by summing all classes except the current one
    other_counts = contingency_table.sum(axis=1) - current_counts
    # Create a new DataFrame for Current and Other
    class_data = pd.DataFrame({
        'Current': current_counts,
        'Other': other_counts
    })
    print(f"{ceap_class} : {class_data}")
    # Perform chi-square test
    chi2_stat, p_value, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(class_data)
    print(f"{ceap_class} - Chi-Square: {chi2_stat:.4f}, p-value: {p_value:.4f}")
    print ("***")

This corrected code will provide more meaningful results for individual classes. Here's an explanation of what we're doing differently:

1. We keep the overall Chi-Square test the same, as it was correct.
2. For individual classes, we create a 2x2 contingency table for each test:
   - One column for the class we're testing
   - One column for all other classes combined
   - Rows still represent Male and Female

This approach allows us to test whether the proportion of patients in a specific CEAP class differs significantly between males and females, considering all other classes as a single group.

The results from this corrected analysis will be more informative and statistically sound. You should see different p-values for each class, allowing you to identify which specific CEAP classes show significant gender differences.

Interpret the results as follows:
- For the overall test and each individual class test, if p < 0.05, there is a statistically significant difference.
- For individual classes, a significant result means the proportion of that class differs significantly between males and females.

This method will provide a more accurate assessment of gender differences for each CEAP class.

Thank you for providing the results. Let's analyze these findings:

## Overall Chi-Square Test

- Chi-Square statistic: 11.2257
- p-value: 0.1291

The overall p-value (0.1291) is greater than the conventional significance level of 0.05. This suggests that, overall, there is no statistically significant association between gender and CEAP classification when considering all classes together.

## Individual CEAP Class Analysis

For each CEAP class:

1. **NA (No disease)**
   - Chi-Square: 1.2988, p-value: 0.2544
   - Not statistically significant (p > 0.05)

2. **C0 (No visible signs)**
   - Chi-Square: 0.1358, p-value: 0.7125
   - Not statistically significant

3. **C1 (Telangiectasias/reticular veins)**
   - Chi-Square: 0.0000, p-value: 1.0000
   - Not statistically significant

4. **C2 (Varicose veins)**
   - Chi-Square: 0.0500, p-value: 0.8231
   - Not statistically significant

5. **C3 (Edema)**
   - Chi-Square: 2.4480, p-value: 0.1177
   - Not statistically significant, but closest to significance among all classes

6. **C4 (Skin changes)**
   - Chi-Square: 0.4132, p-value: 0.5204
   - Not statistically significant

7. **C5 (Healed ulcer)**
   - Chi-Square: 1.3700, p-value: 0.2418
   - Not statistically significant

8. **C6 (Active ulcer)**
   - Chi-Square: 2.3577, p-value: 0.1247
   - Not statistically significant, but second closest to significance

## Interpretation

1. None of the individual CEAP classes show a statistically significant difference between males and females at the conventional 0.05 significance level.

2. The classes that come closest to showing a significant difference are:
   - C3 (Edema): p = 0.1177
   - C6 (Active ulcer): p = 0.1247

3. While we observed some percentage differences in the original data (e.g., C3: 31% in females vs. 25% in males), these differences are not statistically significant when accounting for the overall distribution and sample size.

4. The lack of statistical significance doesn't mean there are no clinical differences; it just indicates that the observed differences could be due to chance rather than a true underlying difference in the population.

5. It's important to note that statistical significance doesn't always equate to clinical significance. Even small, non-significant differences might be clinically relevant in some contexts.

## Conclusion

Based on this analysis, we cannot conclude that there are statistically significant gender differences in the distribution of CEAP classes in this patient population. However, the trends observed, particularly in classes C3 and C6, might warrant further investigation with larger sample sizes or more sensitive statistical methods.
