having examined 326 patients * 2 legs = 724 observations to decide whether each subject to veinous insufficiency disease (CEAP level C0 up to C6) we have a df_line with columns :
doss (patient) : D99999
sexe M,F
limb L,R
age_bin 10_19 thru 90..99
ceap C0...C6

The goal here is to analyze the influence of variables (doss, sexe, limb, age_bin, age) on the severity of venous insufficiency (ceap).

Provide a conceptual framework for py code statistics  

***********
***********
To analyze the influence of variables (`doss`, `sexe`, `limb`, `age_bin`, and `age`) on the severity of venous insufficiency (`ceap`), we can use a combination of descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. Below is a conceptual framework for implementing this analysis in Python:

---

### **1. Data Preparation**
- **Validate Input Data:**
  - Ensure no missing values or invalid entries in critical columns.
  - Verify data consistency (e.g., patient `doss` matches `sexe` across legs).
- **Transform Variables if Needed:**
  - Encode categorical variables (`sexe`, `limb`, `age_bin`, `ceap`) for statistical analysis.

---

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
1. **Summary Statistics:**
   - Frequency distribution of `ceap` by `sexe`, `limb`, and `age_bin`.
   - Mean/median `age` for each `ceap` level.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Bar plots for `ceap` distribution by `sexe` and `limb`.
   - Heatmap of `ceap` counts by `age_bin` and `sexe`.
   - Boxplots for `age` distribution across `ceap` levels.

---

### **3. Inferential Statistics**
#### A. **Assessing Individual Effects**
1. **Ordinal Logistic Regression:**
   - Model `ceap` (ordinal outcome: C0 < C1 < ... < C6) using `sexe`, `limb`, `age_bin`, and `age` as predictors.
   - Use **statsmodels** for implementation.

2. **Generalized Linear Model (GLM):**
   - Treat `ceap` as a categorical variable (nominal).
   - Fit a multinomial logistic regression model.

3. **Mixed-Effects Model:**
   - Account for repeated measures (left/right legs) per patient using a random effect for `doss`.

#### B. **Testing Relationships**
1. **Chi-Square Test of Independence:**
   - Test for independence between `ceap` and categorical variables like `sexe`, `limb`, and `age_bin`.

2. **ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis Test:**
   - Compare `age` distributions across `ceap` levels.

3. **Cochran-Armitage Trend Test:**
   - Test for trends in `ceap` severity across `age_bin` or by gender.

---

### **4. Model Evaluation**
1. **Model Fit:**
   - Assess model fit using goodness-of-fit metrics (e.g., AIC, BIC).
   - Check residuals for patterns to validate assumptions.

2. **Predictive Power:**
   - Evaluate the model's accuracy in predicting `ceap` levels using cross-validation.

3. **Interpret Coefficients:**
   - Identify significant predictors and interpret effect sizes.

---

### **5. Advanced Analysis**
1. **Interaction Effects:**
   - Include interactions (e.g., `sexe:age`, `limb:age_bin`) to explore combined effects.

2. **Age Bin Refinement:**
   - If `age_bin` has uneven group sizes, consider merging sparse bins or switching to continuous `age`.

3. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Conduct specific trend tests for age effects across `ceap` classes.

---

### **6. Implementation in Python**
Here's a high-level outline for the Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency, kruskal
from statsmodels.formula.api import ols, ordinal_logit
from statsmodels.stats.proportion import cochran_armitage_test
from statsmodels.stats.anova import anova_lm

# Load Data
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# 1. Data Preparation
df.dropna(subset=['ceap', 'sexe', 'limb', 'age_bin'], inplace=True)

# 2. EDA
# Visualizations
sns.countplot(data=df, x='ceap', hue='sexe')
plt.show()

# 3. Statistical Modeling
# Ordinal Logistic Regression
import statsmodels.api as sm
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

model = smf.mnlogit("ceap ~ sexe + limb + age + age_bin", data=df)
results = model.fit()
print(results.summary())

# Mixed Effects Model
from statsmodels.regression.mixed_linear_model import MixedLM

mixed_model = MixedLM.from_formula("ceap ~ sexe + limb + age", groups="doss", data=df)
mixed_results = mixed_model.fit()
print(mixed_results.summary())

# 4. Advanced Analysis
# Cochran-Armitage Trend Test
trend_result = cochran_armitage_test(df['age_bin'], df['ceap'])
print(trend_result)
```

****************************
The **Cochran-Armitage Trend Test** is specifically designed to test for a **linear trend** in proportions across ordered groups (e.g., increasing disease severity with age groups or other ordinal predictors). It assesses whether the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., presence/absence of a condition) changes monotonically (increases or decreases) as the levels of an ordinal predictor increase.

---

### **Type of Trend**
- The trend tested is **linear** (monotonic) across the ordered categories.
- For example:
  - Testing whether the proportion of patients with a certain condition increases across age bins (e.g., `10-19`, `20-29`, ..., `90-99`).
  - The null hypothesis assumes no consistent trend, while the alternative hypothesis assumes a monotonic change (increase or decrease).

---

### **Hypotheses**
1. **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\)):**
   - There is **no linear trend** in the proportions of the binary outcome across the levels of the ordinal predictor.
   - Example: The proportion of patients with CEAP class C6 is constant across age bins.

2. **Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_a\)):**
   - There **is a linear trend** in the proportions of the binary outcome across the levels of the ordinal predictor.
   - Example: The proportion of patients with CEAP class C6 increases with age bins.

---

### **Key Points:**
- The test assumes:
  1. The predictor variable is ordinal (e.g., age bins, severity levels).
  2. The response variable is binary (e.g., presence/absence of CEAP C6).
- The test statistic follows a chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom.

---

### **Implementation in Python**
Here's an example of implementing the Cochran-Armitage Trend Test in Python:

#### For Binary Outcome:

```python
from statsmodels.stats.proportion import cochran_armitage_test
import numpy as np

# Data: age bins and binary response (e.g., CEAP C6 presence/absence)
# Rows: Age Bins; Columns: [Non-CEAP C6, CEAP C6]
data = np.array([
    [50, 5],   # Age Bin 10-19
    [40, 15],  # Age Bin 20-29
    [30, 25],  # Age Bin 30-39
    [20, 35],  # Age Bin 40-49
    [10, 45],  # Age Bin 50-59
])

# Perform the Cochran-Armitage Trend Test
result = cochran_armitage_test(data)
print("Statistic:", result.statistic)
print("P-value:", result.pvalue)
```

---

### **Interpreting Results:**
- **P-value > 0.05**: Fail to reject \(H_0\); there is no significant trend.
- **P-value â‰¤ 0.05**: Reject \(H_0\); a significant linear trend exists in the proportions.

If you suspect a non-linear trend, alternative methods (e.g., generalized linear models with ordinal predictors) would be more appropriate.
