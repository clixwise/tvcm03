The **Cochran-Armitage Trend Test** specifically tests for a **linear trend**, meaning it assumes the proportion of the binary outcome (e.g., presence/absence of a CEAP class) changes monotonically across the ordered predictor levels (e.g., age bins). 

If your trend is **monotonic but quadratic** (e.g., the outcome increases up to a certain point and then decreases, or vice versa), the Cochran-Armitage test may not fully capture the complexity of this relationship. 

---

### **Why Cochran-Armitage May Not Be Suitable**
- Cochran-Armitage is not designed to detect **non-linear trends**, such as quadratic or other curvilinear patterns.
- Applying the test in this case could lead to misleading results, as it would only assess the linear component of the trend and ignore higher-order effects.

---

### **Alternative Approaches**
To detect or model a quadratic trend with ordinal predictors like `age_bin`, consider the following approaches:

---

#### **1. Generalized Linear Models (GLM)**
Use a logistic regression model to explicitly include both the linear and quadratic terms for `age`.

Example in Python:
```python
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

# Add a quadratic term for age_bin (encoded as integers, e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...)
df['age_bin_numeric'] = df['age_bin'].astype('category').cat.codes
df['age_bin_quadratic'] = df['age_bin_numeric'] ** 2

# Logistic regression with linear and quadratic terms
model = smf.logit("ceap_binary ~ age_bin_numeric + age_bin_quadratic + sexe + limb", data=df)
result = model.fit()
print(result.summary())
```

- If the quadratic term (`age_bin_quadratic`) is significant, it indicates a non-linear relationship.
- Interpret the coefficients to understand the shape of the trend.

---

#### **2. Chi-Square Test with Binned Data**
If you want a simpler method:
- Perform a **Chi-Square Test of Independence** for `ceap_binary` and `age_bin`.
- Interpret contingency table results to assess deviations in proportions across bins (though this won't confirm quadraticity directly).

---

#### **3. Polynomial Regression**
If `age` is continuous, fit a polynomial regression model:
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Prepare polynomial terms
X = df['age'].values.reshape(-1, 1)
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)

# Logistic regression
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_poly, df['ceap_binary'])

# Coefficients for linear and quadratic terms
print(model.coef_)
```

---

#### **4. Smoothing Methods**
Use non-parametric methods like **LOESS** or **splines** to visualize trends:
```python
import seaborn as sns

sns.lmplot(data=df, x='age', y='ceap_binary', logistic=True, order=2)
```

---

### **Takeaway**
- **Cochran-Armitage Trend Test** is suitable for detecting **linear trends**.
- For quadratic or more complex trends, use logistic regression with higher-order terms, polynomial regression, or non-parametric smoothing.
- Carefully check the statistical significance and fit of your chosen model to ensure it aligns with the observed trend in your data.

Got it! If you have multiple `ceap_binary` values for each `age_bin`, the analysis will involve **aggregating** or **handling repeated measures** to properly capture the relationship between age bins and the binary outcome (`ceap_binary`). Here's how you can adapt the analysis:

---

### **Updated Problem Statement**
- Each `age_bin_numeric` has multiple `ceap_binary` values (one per observation/patient).
- The goal remains to assess the trend in `ceap_binary` across `age_bin_numeric`, potentially incorporating polynomial terms.

---

### **Approach**
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Ensure the dataset represents individual observations (i.e., one row per patient with their `age_bin_numeric` and `ceap_binary`).

2. **Generating Polynomial Terms:**
   - Use `age_bin_numeric` to create polynomial features for modeling.

3. **Logistic Regression with Repeated Observations:**
   - Fit a logistic regression model to predict `ceap_binary` as a function of `age_bin_numeric` (and its polynomial terms).

4. **Mixed-Effects Model (Optional):**
   - If you want to account for patient-level random effects (e.g., within-subject correlation), use a mixed-effects logistic regression.

---

### **Implementation**
#### **Step 1: Data Preparation**
Hereâ€™s an example dataset reflecting your case:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example dataset with multiple observations per age_bin
data = {
    "age_bin_numeric": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6],
    "ceap_binary": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

---

#### **Step 2: Generate Polynomial Terms**
Use `age_bin_numeric` to create polynomial features.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures

# Specify the maximum degree for the polynomial
max_degree = 2  # Quadratic

# Create polynomial features
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=max_degree, include_bias=False)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(df[['age_bin_numeric']])

# Add polynomial terms back to the DataFrame
poly_columns = [f"age_bin_numeric^{i}" for i in range(1, max_degree + 1)]
X_poly_df = pd.DataFrame(X_poly, columns=poly_columns)
df_poly = pd.concat([df, X_poly_df], axis=1)
```

---

#### **Step 3: Logistic Regression**
Fit a logistic regression model using the polynomial terms.

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Add a constant for the intercept
X = sm.add_constant(df_poly[poly_columns])
y = df_poly['ceap_binary']

# Fit logistic regression
logit_model = sm.Logit(y, X)
result = logit_model.fit()

# Summary of the model
print(result.summary())
```

---

#### **Step 4: Mixed-Effects Model (Optional)**
If you want to account for repeated measures (e.g., nested within age bins):

```python
from statsmodels.regression.mixed_linear_model import MixedLM

# Mixed-effects logistic regression with random intercepts by age_bin
mixed_model = MixedLM(df['ceap_binary'], X, groups=df['age_bin_numeric'])
mixed_results = mixed_model.fit()

print(mixed_results.summary())
```

---

### **Key Considerations**
1. **Interpretation of Polynomial Terms:**
   - The significance of quadratic (and higher-order) terms indicates whether non-linear trends exist.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize the predicted probabilities to understand the relationship:
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # Predict probabilities
   df['predicted_prob'] = result.predict(X)

   # Average predicted probabilities per age_bin
   prob_by_bin = df.groupby('age_bin_numeric')['predicted_prob'].mean()

   # Plot
   plt.plot(prob_by_bin.index, prob_by_bin.values, marker='o', label="Predicted Probabilities")
   plt.xlabel("Age Bin")
   plt.ylabel("Probability of CEAP Binary")
   plt.legend()
   plt.show()
   ```

3. **Overfitting:**
   - Limit the maximum polynomial degree to avoid overfitting.

4. **Goodness of Fit:**
   - Use metrics like AIC/BIC or cross-validation to evaluate and compare models.

---

### **Output**
- **Logistic Regression Coefficients**: Quantify the effect of `age_bin` and its polynomial terms on `ceap_binary`.
- **Visual Trends**: Validate the monotonic quadratic or other patterns in the trend.

This method dynamically handles the multiple observations for each age bin while deriving polynomial features for modeling!

******************************************
Thank you for clarifying! Since **`ceap` is a categorical variable** (with values `C0, C1, ..., C6` representing different levels of venous insufficiency severity), the analysis framework needs to account for a **multinomial (categorical) outcome** rather than a binary outcome. Here's an updated approach:

---

### **Goal**
Model the influence of predictors like `age_bin`, `age`, and possibly higher-order terms (e.g., quadratic trends) on the categorical outcome `ceap` (`C0, C1, ..., C6`).

---

### **Statistical Approach**
#### 1. **Multinomial Logistic Regression (Generalized Logits Model)**:
   - Treat `ceap` as a **multinomial outcome**.
   - Predict the probabilities of each `ceap` category (e.g., \(P(C0)\), \(P(C1)\), ..., \(P(C6)\)) as functions of the predictors.
   - Use polynomial terms for `age_bin` or `age` to capture potential quadratic (or higher-order) trends.

#### 2. **Ordinal Logistic Regression**:
   - If `ceap` values have an **inherent order** (e.g., severity increases from `C0` to `C6`), you can use an **ordinal logistic regression** to model this ordinal relationship.

---

### **Step-by-Step Implementation**
#### **Step 1: Data Preparation**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Example dataset with multiple observations per age_bin
data = {
    "age_bin_numeric": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6],
    "ceap": ["C0", "C1", "C2", "C2", "C3", "C4", "C1", "C4", "C6", "C3", "C5", "C6", "C4", "C4", "C6", "C6", "C5", "C6"],
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

---

#### **Step 2: Multinomial Logistic Regression**
Use a multinomial logistic regression model to predict `ceap` based on `age_bin_numeric` and its polynomial terms.

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures

# Convert ceap to numeric encoding
df['ceap_numeric'] = df['ceap'].astype('category').cat.codes  # C0=0, C1=1, ..., C6=6

# Generate polynomial features for age_bin
max_degree = 2  # Quadratic
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=max_degree, include_bias=False)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(df[['age_bin_numeric']])
poly_columns = [f"age_bin_numeric^{i}" for i in range(1, max_degree + 1)]
X_poly_df = pd.DataFrame(X_poly, columns=poly_columns)

# Add polynomial terms to DataFrame
df_poly = pd.concat([df, X_poly_df], axis=1)

# Multinomial logistic regression
X = sm.add_constant(df_poly[poly_columns])  # Predictors
y = df_poly['ceap_numeric']                # Outcome
multinomial_model = sm.MNLogit(y, X)
result = multinomial_model.fit()

# Summary of the model
print(result.summary())
```

---

#### **Step 3: Ordinal Logistic Regression (If `ceap` is Ordered)**
Use ordinal logistic regression to model the ordered nature of `ceap`:

```python
from statsmodels.miscmodels.ordinal_model import OrderedModel

# Ordinal logistic regression
X = sm.add_constant(df_poly[poly_columns])  # Predictors
y = df_poly['ceap_numeric']                # Outcome
ordinal_model = OrderedModel(y, X, distr='logit')  # 'probit' is also an option
ordinal_result = ordinal_model.fit()

# Summary of the model
print(ordinal_result.summary())
```

---

#### **Step 4: Visualization**
Visualize the predicted probabilities for each `ceap` category across `age_bin_numeric`:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Predicted probabilities
predicted_probs = result.predict(X)

# Aggregate predictions for visualization
age_bins = df['age_bin_numeric'].unique()
categories = sorted(df['ceap'].unique())
probs_by_bin = []

for i, bin_val in enumerate(age_bins):
    avg_probs = predicted_probs[df['age_bin_numeric'] == bin_val].mean(axis=0)
    probs_by_bin.append(avg_probs)

# Convert to DataFrame for plotting
probs_by_bin = pd.DataFrame(probs_by_bin, columns=categories, index=age_bins)

# Plot probabilities for each ceap category
probs_by_bin.plot(kind='line', marker='o')
plt.xlabel("Age Bin")
plt.ylabel("Predicted Probability")
plt.title("Predicted Probabilities of CEAP Categories Across Age Bins")
plt.legend(title="CEAP")
plt.show()
```

---

### **Model Comparison**
- **Use AIC/BIC** to compare models with and without higher-order terms (e.g., linear vs. quadratic vs. cubic).
- **Cross-validation** can validate the model's predictive performance.

---

### **Key Insights**
1. **Multinomial Logistic Regression**:
   - Useful when `ceap` is a nominal variable with no intrinsic order.
   - Predicts probabilities for all categories independently.

2. **Ordinal Logistic Regression**:
   - Captures the ordinal nature of `ceap`.
   - Assumes proportional odds across predictors.

3. **Trend Testing**:
   - Significance of higher-order terms (e.g., quadratic) will indicate the presence of a non-linear trend in severity.

4. **Interpretation**:
   - Look at coefficients and predicted probabilities to identify the effect of predictors on `ceap`.

This framework allows you to analyze how predictors (e.g., age_bin, age) influence the categorical severity levels of venous insufficiency (`ceap`).
