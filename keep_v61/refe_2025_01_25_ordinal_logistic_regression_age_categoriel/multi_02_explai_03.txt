For statistical testing, the choice of whether to use the **encoded DataFrame** or more traditional approaches like Chi-square tests on a contingency table depends on your research goals and the specific relationships you want to analyze. Let's break it down stepwise:

---

### **Step 1: Decide on the Testing Objective**
1. **Traditional Methods (e.g., Chi-square, Fisher's Exact Test)**:
   - Best for **pairwise or small-scale analysis**.
   - Works on **raw categorical data** (e.g., cross-tabulations of `ceap` with `sexe` or `limb`).

2. **Modern Regression-Based Statistical Testing**:
   - Best for **multi-variable and more complex relationships**.
   - Requires **encoded data** to fit models like logistic regression, ordinal regression, or mixed-effects models.

Since you want to start with **statistical testing** and explore influence across multiple variables, we’ll proceed with **modern regression-based methods**.

---

### **Step 2: Why Use Encoded Data for Regression?**
Regression-based approaches:
- Handle continuous, ordinal, and categorical variables simultaneously.
- Allow adjustment for covariates (e.g., `age`, `sexe`).
- Provide detailed results, like effect sizes and p-values, for each predictor.

For example:
- A **proportional odds model** for ordinal `ceap` can evaluate the effect of predictors like `age` or `sexe`.
- A **generalized linear model** can model binary outcomes (`VI` or `non-VI`) and assess relationships with encoded predictors.

---

### **Step 3: Outline for Statistical Testing with Encoded Data**

#### **3.1 Data Preparation**
1. Use the **encoded DataFrame**:
   - Binary encode `sexe`.
   - Ordinal encode `ceap` (e.g., `NA=0, C0=1, ..., C6=7`).
   - One-hot encode or dummy-code nominal variables like `unbi`, `mbas`, `mbre`.

2. Ensure no missing values:
   - Impute or exclude rows with missing data.

#### **3.2 Model-Based Statistical Testing**
Here are common regression models you might use:

1. **Ordinal Logistic Regression (Proportional Odds Model)**:
   - Used for `ceap` as an ordinal outcome.
   - Equation:
     \[
     \log \left( \frac{P(Y \leq j)}{P(Y > j)} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot Sexe + \beta_2 \cdot Age + \ldots
     \]
   - Software:
     - Python: `statsmodels` or `scikit-learn` (`OrdinalEncoder` + LogisticRegression).
     - R: `MASS::polr`.

2. **Mixed-Effects Logistic Regression**:
   - Accounts for **patient-level clustering** (two legs per patient).
   - Outcome: Binary `VI` (present/absent) or binary transformation of `ceap` (e.g., `C3-C6` vs. `C0-C2`).

3. **Multinomial Logistic Regression**:
   - For `ceap` treated as categorical without assuming an order.

4. **Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)**:
   - For continuous predictors (e.g., `age`) and their effect on binary outcomes like `VI`.

### **Step 4: Perform the Analysis**

#### **Example: Ordinal Logistic Regression in Python**
```python
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.miscmodels.ordinal_model import OrderedModel

# Prepare the encoded DataFrame
df_encoded = ...  # Your encoded DataFrame

# Define predictors and target
X = df_encoded[['age', 'sexe', 'unbi_B', 'unbi_U', 'mbas_G2', 'mbre_G']]  # Example predictors
y = df_encoded['ceap']  # Ordinal target

# Fit an ordinal logistic regression model
model = OrderedModel(y, sm.add_constant(X), distr='logit')
result = model.fit(method='bfgs')

# Summary of results
print(result.summary())
```

#### **Example: Mixed-Effects Logistic Regression in Python**
```python
from statsmodels.formula.api import mixedlm

# Binary outcome (e.g., VI present/absent)
df_encoded['VI_binary'] = (df_encoded['ceap'] >= 3).astype(int)

# Mixed-effects logistic regression
model = mixedlm("VI_binary ~ age + sexe + unbi_B + unbi_U", 
                df_encoded, 
                groups=df_encoded['doss'])
result = model.fit()

# Summary of results
print(result.summary())
```

---

### **Step 5: Interpret the Results**
- Look for:
  - Significant predictors (p-values < 0.05).
  - Direction of effects (positive/negative coefficients).
  - Fit statistics (e.g., AIC, BIC) for model quality.

---

### **Step 6: Validate Findings**
- Perform residual diagnostics.
- Compare with results from traditional methods for robustness.

---

### Why Not Use Chi-Square?
While Chi-square and similar tests are excellent for pairwise testing, they don’t:
- Account for covariates (e.g., age or sexe).
- Handle continuous or ordinal variables flexibly.
- Provide insight into multivariable relationships.
