Thank you for the feedback. You're right, the code is cleaner now, but we're still encountering an issue. The error "There should not be a constant in the model" persists, and we're also seeing some infinity values in the Variance Inflation Factors (VIF). Let's address these issues:

1. VIF Infinity: This occurs due to perfect multicollinearity between some variables. In this case, it's likely because we have binary variables that are perfectly correlated (e.g., sexe[F] and sexe[M] are perfectly negatively correlated).

2. Constant in the model: Despite our efforts, the model still detects a constant. This could be due to how patsy is handling the categorical variables.

Let's modify the code to address these issues:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from statsmodels.miscmodels.ordinal_model import OrderedModel
from patsy import dmatrix

# ... (previous code for creating the DataFrame remains the same)

# Create design matrix without intercept and drop one level of each categorical variable
X = dmatrix('0 + C(sexe, Drop(1)) + C(limb, Drop(1)) + C(age_bin, Drop(1))', data=df, return_type='dataframe')

# Prepare y (outcome)
y = pd.Categorical(df['ceap']).codes

print("Predictors (X):")
print(X)
print("\n")

print("Outcome (y):")
print(pd.Series(y).value_counts())
print("\n")

# Fit the ordinal logistic regression model
try:
    model = OrderedModel(y, X, distr='logit')
    results = model.fit()

    # Print the summary of results
    print(results.summary())

    # Calculate and print odds ratios
    odds_ratios = np.exp(results.params)
    print("\nOdds Ratios:")
    print(odds_ratios)

except ValueError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

This modified code:

1. Uses `C(variable, Drop(1))` in the dmatrix formula to explicitly drop one level of each categorical variable, avoiding perfect multicollinearity.
2. Removes the VIF calculation as it's not necessary for this small example and was causing issues.
3. Simplifies the output to focus on the model results.

This approach should resolve both the multicollinearity and constant term issues. However, please note that with only 6 observations and multiple predictors, the model may still be overfit and results should be interpreted with extreme caution. In practice, you would need a much larger dataset (like your full 326 patients) to draw meaningful conclusions.
