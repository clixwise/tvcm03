The error you're encountering is due to the presence of a constant term in the model, which is not allowed in OrderedModel. To resolve this issue, we need to modify our approach. Here's an explanation of the problem and a solution:

1. The error "There should not be a constant in the model" occurs because OrderedModel automatically includes intercept terms for each level of the ordinal outcome. Adding an extra constant term would lead to perfect multicollinearity.

2. When using the formula interface, it automatically includes an intercept term, which causes the same issue.

To fix this, we need to explicitly exclude the intercept when specifying the model. Here's how to modify the code:

```python
from patsy import dmatrix

# Create design matrix without intercept
X = dmatrix('0 + sexe + limb + age_bin', data=df, return_type='dataframe')

# Fit the ordinal logistic regression model
model = OrderedModel(y, X, distr='logit')
results = model.fit()

print(results.summary())

# Calculate and print odds ratios
odds_ratios = np.exp(results.params)
print("\nOdds Ratios:")
print(odds_ratios)
```

This approach:

1. Uses `patsy.dmatrix` to create a design matrix without an intercept (note the `0 +` at the beginning of the formula).
2. Explicitly specifies the predictors without adding a constant term.

By making these changes, you should be able to fit the ordinal logistic regression model successfully. The resulting output will provide coefficients and odds ratios for each predictor, allowing you to interpret the effects of sex, limb, and age group on the CEAP classification.

Remember that in ordinal logistic regression:

- Positive coefficients indicate that higher values of the predictor are associated with higher probabilities of being in higher-ordered outcome categories.
- Odds ratios greater than 1 indicate that the predictor is associated with higher odds of being in a higher category of the outcome variable.

Interpret the results carefully, considering the clinical significance alongside the statistical significance, and be mindful of the small sample size in your example dataset.
