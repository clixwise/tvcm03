Here's a concept-to-approach outline for tackling your two objectives:

---

### **1. Retrospective Statistical Analysis**
The goal here is to analyze the influence of variables (`doss`, `sexe`, `limb`, `age_bin`, `age`) on the severity of venous insufficiency (`ceap`).

#### **Step 1.1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Univariate Analysis:**
  - Frequency distribution of `ceap`.
  - Distribution of `age` and `age_bin`.
  - Gender distribution (`sexe`) and limb prevalence (`limb`).

- **Bivariate Analysis:**
  - Cross-tabulate `ceap` levels with categorical variables like `sexe`, `limb`, and `age_bin`.
  - Visualize relationships using heatmaps, bar plots, or boxplots (e.g., `age` vs. `ceap`).

- **Multivariate Analysis:**
  - Check for interactions between independent variables (e.g., age and limb, sexe and age).

---

#### **Step 1.2: Statistical Tests**
1. **Categorical Variables (`sexe`, `limb`, `age_bin`):**
   - Use Chi-square or Fisher's exact test to assess relationships with `ceap`.
   - Cochran-Armitage test for linear trends (if ordered categories are present).

2. **Continuous Variables (`age`):**
   - Use Kruskal-Wallis or ANOVA to compare age distributions across `ceap` levels.
   - Linear or logistic regression to test for monotonic trends.

3. **Mixed Effects Modeling:**
   - Use a mixed-effects model to account for within-patient correlations (2 legs per patient):
     \[
     CEAP \sim Sexe + Age + Limb + (1|Patient)
     \]
     - `Patient` as a random effect.
     - Age as continuous or binned variable.
     - `CEAP` as ordinal (proportional odds model) or categorical (multinomial logistic regression).

---

#### **Step 1.3: Residual Diagnostics**
- Examine residuals for normality, independence, and homoscedasticity.
- Assess goodness-of-fit using pseudo-\(R^2\) measures or log-likelihood.

---

### **2. Train an AI System**
The aim is to predict the `ceap` level using variables like `sexe`, `limb`, `age`, and `age_bin`.

---

#### **Step 2.1: Data Preparation**
- **Encoding:**
  - Convert categorical variables (`sexe`, `limb`, `age_bin`) into numerical features (e.g., one-hot or ordinal encoding).
- **Scaling:**
  - Standardize/normalize `age` to improve algorithm performance.

- **Train-Test Split:**
  - Split data into training (70-80%) and testing (20-30%) sets.
  - Use stratified sampling to maintain `ceap` distribution.

---

#### **Step 2.2: Model Selection**
1. **Baseline Models:**
   - Logistic regression for binary prediction (e.g., presence/absence of venous insufficiency).
   - Multinomial logistic regression or ordinal regression for `ceap` levels.

2. **Advanced Models:**
   - Random Forests or Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost) for feature importance.
   - Neural Networks for complex, non-linear relationships.

3. **Consider Patient Correlation:**
   - Use models capable of handling hierarchies, such as hierarchical Bayesian models or mixed-effects machine learning models.

---

#### **Step 2.3: Model Training and Evaluation**
1. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for classification.
   - Mean absolute error (MAE) or \( R^2 \) for continuous predictions.
   - Use k-fold cross-validation to avoid overfitting.

2. **Feature Importance:**
   - Identify the most influential predictors using feature importance scores or SHAP values.

---

#### **Step 2.4: Model Deployment**
- Optimize the model for interpretability or accuracy based on the use case (e.g., clinical decision support).
- Create a pipeline for continuous training and re-evaluation as new data arrives.

---

#### **Optional Step: Temporal and Longitudinal Studies**
If you have follow-up data or temporal trends, include time-based models to study disease progression or response to treatment.
